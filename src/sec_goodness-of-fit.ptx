  <introduction xml:id="sec_goodness-of-fit_intro">
  	<title>Testing Multiple Proportions</title>
  	<p>As was the case with testing multiple means, we need to be careful how we test multiple proportions. Consider the following example.</p>
  	<example xml:id="examp_goodness-of-fit_multiple-tests">
  		<title>Testing a Statement About Multiple Proportions</title>
  		<statement>
  			<p>A mixed nut product claims to contain 40% peanuts, 25% hazelnuts, 15% cashews, 10% brazil nuts, and 10% other assorted nuts. You wish to test this claim by purchasing a container of mixed nuts and determining the proportion of each type of nut in your sample. How could this be done using the hypothesis tests we&apos;ve seen thus far?</p>
  		</statement>
  		<solution>
  			<p>We could conduct five different hypothesis tests:
  				<ol label="1" cols="3">

  		</solution>
  	</example>
  	<p>Once again, the problem we run into is that with each test, we increase the likelihood that we will make a mistake. Also, if we conduct these separate tests, we are treating the process as if it were binomial<mdash/>with only two outcomes. In actuality, this process has five possible outcomes<mdash/>the five types of nuts. In this section we will introduce a hypothesis test designed to check if a process with more than two  possible outcomes like this has a given distribution of probabilities. Because it is designed to check how well an observed set of outcomes fits a given list of probabilities, the test is called the <term>goodness-of-fit test</term>.</p>

	<subsection xml:id="sec_goodness-of-fit_multinomial">
		<title>Multinomial Processes</title>
		<p>Recall that in <xref ref="sec_binomial"/> we introduced the concept of a <xref ref="def_binomial-process" text="custom">binomial process</xref>. The characteristics of a binomial process were defined to be:
		  <ol label="1">
		  	<li><p>The process consists of a fixed number of trials, each of which had only two possible outcomes: success or failure.</p></li>
		  	<li><p>Each trial has the same probability of a success, <m>p</m>.</p></li>
		  	<li><p>The trials are all independent of each other.</p></li>
		  	<li><p>The result variable is the number of trials which result in successes.</p></li>
		  </ol>
		</p>
		<p>Our mixed nuts example from the introduction has many of these same properties. However, the process of categorizing nuts is not binomial because each nut may fall into one of five different categories (peanut, hazelnut, etc). In a binomial process we are only allowed two possible categories: success and failure. Since our hypothesis tests for proportions are based on the assumption that we are dealing with a binomial process with only two outcomes, we need a new type of process that will work with problems such as the mixed nuts example.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_multinomial-process">
			<idx>multinomial process</idx>
			<statement>
				<p>A <term>multinomial process</term> is a random process in which:

				  </ol>
				</p>
				<p>The result of the process is the frequency with which each of the possible categories appear.</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		<p>Let&apos;s look at a couple of examples to see if we can identify multinomial processes.</p>
	  <example xml:id="examp_goodness-of-fit_identify-multinomial-true">
	  	<title>Identifying a Multinomial Process</title>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>A mixed nut product claims to contain 40% peanuts, 25% hazelnuts, 15% cashews, 10% brazil nuts, and 10% other assorted nuts. You wish to test this claim by purchasing a container of mixed nuts and determining the proportion of each type of nut in your sample. Is this a multinomial process?</p>
	  	</statement>
	  	<solution>
	  		<p>Let&apos;s check to see if this process is multinomial by checking each property.
	  		  <ol label="1">
	  		    <li><title>The process consists of a fixed number of identical trials</title>
	  		      <p>The trials are drawing a single nut from the container. There are a fixed number of trials because there are a fixed number of nuts in the container.</p></li>
	  		    <li><title>The outcome of each trial is one of a set number of possibilities</title>
	  		      <p>In this case, there are five classifications of nuts. Thus, there are only five possible outcomes: peanut, hazelnut, cashew, brazil nut, or other type of nut.</p></li>
	  		    <li><title>The probability of each category is fixed</title>
	  		      <p>although we don&apos;t yet know what it is (we want to test to see if it is 40% peanuts, 25% hazelnuts, etc), the probability of getting a nut of each type is fixed (assuming there are enough nuts in the population).</p></li>
	  		    <li><title>The trials are independent</title>
	  		      <p>If we consider the container of nuts we purchased to be a sample from the larger population of nuts. In this case, it is almost certain that the sample container is much smaller than (less than 5% of) the population of nuts in the packing facility.</p></li>
	  		  </ol>
	  		</p>
	  		<p>Because each of the four properties is true, this is a multinomial process.</p>
	  	</solution>
	  </example>
	  <example xml:id="examp_goodness-of-fit_multinomial-false">
	  	<title>Identifying When a Process is Not Multinomial</title>
	  	<statement>
	  		<p>A process consists of drawing marbles from an urn containing 1000 red marbles, 500 blue marbles, and 250 green marbles without replacement. Marbles are drawn until two green marbles have been observed. Is this a multinomial process?</p>
	  	</statement>
	  	<solution>
	  		<p>This process violates the very first condition. There is no fixed number of times that we draw a marble. If our first two marbles are green, we will stop at <m>n = 2</m> draws. On the other hand, it could take us hundreds of draws before we see two green marbles. Because there is not a set number of trials, this is not a multinomial process.</p>

	<subsection xml:id="sec_goodness-of-fit_hypotheses">
		<title>Formulating Hypotheses</title>
		<p>A goodness-of-fit test is used to test a claim about the probabilities in a multinomial process. That is, we specify ahead of time what we believe the probability of each of the <m>k</m> categories should be. We then take a sample and look at the observed probability of those categories. If they are different enough from what we claimed the probabilities should be, we conclude that our claim was wrong. Since this claim involves equality (we specify what we assume the probabilities will be), it is the null hypothesis.</p>
		<principle xml:id="thm_hypotheses-goodness-of-fit">
			<title>Hypotheses for Goodness-of-Fit Tests</title>
			<idx><h>hypothesis test</h><h>goodness-of-fit</h><h>hypotheses</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>In a goodness-of-fit hypothesis test, we assume that a multinomial process will have probabilities <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k</m>. The opposite of this claim is that at least one of the probabilities is different from what we specify.  Thus, the null and alternative hypotheses are:
				  <md>
				  	<mrow>H_0\amp:\ \text{Category probabilities are } p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k</mrow>
				  	<mrow>H_A\amp:\ \text{At least one of the category probabilities is different from those above}</mrow>
				  </md>
				</p>
			</statement>
		</principle>
		<p>Null hypotheses can be phrased in one of two ways. The first is as a set probabilities, as was the case in our mixed nuts example.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_goodness-of-fit_hypotheses-set">
			<title>Stating Hypotheses for a Goodness-of-Fit Test Based on Given Probabilities</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A mixed nut product claims to contain 40% peanuts, 25% hazelnuts, 15% cashews, 10% Brazil nuts, and 10% other assorted nuts. You wish to test this claim by purchasing a container of mixed nuts and determining the proportion of each type of nut in your sample. What are your hypotheses?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>In this problem statement, we are told what the probabilities of each outcome should be. Stating those as our null hypothesis, we get:
					<md>
						<mrow>H_0\amp :\ p_1 = 0.40,\ \ p_2 = 0.25,\ \ p_3 = 0.15,\ \ p_4 = 0.10,\ \ p_5 = 0.10</mrow>
						<mrow>H_A\amp:\ \text{At least one of these probabilities is different}</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		<p>Another common way that the null hypothesis can be phrased is in terms of relative proportions. We could claim that the outcomes are all equally likely, that one outcome is twice as likely as another, or some similar statement.</p>
		<example xml:id="examp_goodness-of-fit_hypotheses-relative">
			<title>Stating Hypotheses for a Goodness-of-Fit Test Based on Relative Probabilities</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A politician believes that the proportion of Republicans, Democrats, and independents in a certain congressional district are equal. To test this claim, she hires a polling firm to sample 500 registered voters. They find that 183 of them are Republicans, 142 of them are Democrats, and 175 of them are independents. What should the null hypothesis be for a goodness-of-fit test of the politician&apos;s claim?</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>In this case, the claim is that all three political parties are equally likely. If the probability of one of them is called <m>x</m>, then stating they are equal and recognizing that their probabilities have to sum to one gives us the following equation.
				  <me>x + x + x = 1</me>
				</p>
				<p>If we solve that for <m>x</m>, we find that <m>x = \frac{1}{3}</m>. Thus, our null and alternative hypothesis should be:
				  <md>
				  	<mrow>H_0\amp:\ p_R = p_D = p_I = \frac{1}{3}</mrow>
				  	<mrow>H_A\amp:\ \text{The probabilities are not as described above}</mrow>

		<title>Observed and Expected Counts</title>
		<p>In a goodness-of-fit test, our goal is to compare what happens in a sample drawn from the population being studied with what we expected to happen based on the null hypothesis. The result of the sample we draw will be a list of frequencies, or counts, for each category.</p>
		<definition xml:id="def_observed-counts">

				<p>The number of times in a process that each category of outcome occurred are together called the <term>observed counts</term> for that category.</p>

		<p>Our null hypothesis tells us what we expect the probability of each category to be. In order to compare these expected outcomes, we must convert these probabilities into expected counts. We can then compare the counts that we observed with the counts that we expected. To compute the expected counts for each category, we use the following procedure.</p>
		<theorem xml:id="thm_expected-counts_multinomial">

		<title>The <m>\chi^2</m>-Distribution</title>
		<p>In order to measure the differences between observed and expected counts, we will need yet another distribution. This distribution is useful in hypothesis tests involving squares. As we shall see, we will use squares in the goodness-of-fit test statistic. The family of distributions, called <m>\chi^2</m> (pronounced /&apos;kai skwered/) distributions, are described below.</p>

		<p>As was the case in the F-distribution, because we are always looking for large differences between observed and expected counts, we will reject the null hypothesis, which generates the expected counts, when we have large test statistics. Therefore, we will usually use right-tailed tests.  However, we can use left-tailed tests to look for observed and expected counts that match too well. The following examples allow us to practice looking up critical values using the table for members of the <m>\chi^2</m>-distribution family.</p>

		<title>The Test Statistic</title>
		<p>To compute the test statistic for a goodness-of-fit test, our goal is to measure how far off our observed counts are from our expected counts. To do this, we want to examine the difference between observed and expected, but we don&apos;t care which is larger. Thus, we square that difference. Finally, we scale the difference by dividing by the expected counts. This is done because a difference of 10 means a lot more when only 15 were expected than it would if 100 were expected.</p>

				<p>To make our decision, we want to compare this test statistic with the critical value that separates the top <m>\alpha = 0.05</m> in the right tail of a <m>\chi^2</m>-distribution with with <m>df = 5-1 = 4</m> degrees of freedom (since there are five categories of nuts) from the rest of the distribution.

				<p>Since the test statistic of 5.784 is not further into the right-tail than the critical value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. It looks like this sample does fit the claimed distribution of nuts.</p>

			<title>Conducting a Goodness-of-Fit Test for Relative Probabilities</title>
			<statement>
				<p>A politician believes that the proportion of Republicans, Democrats, and independents in a certain congressional district are equal. To test this claim, she hires a polling firm to sample 500 registered voters. They find that 183 of them are Republicans, 142 of them are Democrats, and 175 of them are independents. Test this claim at the <m>\alpha = 0.10</m> significance level.</p>
